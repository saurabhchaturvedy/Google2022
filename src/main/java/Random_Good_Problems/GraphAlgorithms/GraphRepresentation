1 . ADJACENCY LIST : We assign a data structure (array) to every single vertex (node) in the graph that stores the edges accordingly .

[edgeWeight,ConnectedVertex] [(4,C)(2,B)]

Space efficient when dealing with sparse graphs but inefficient with dense ones


2 . ADJACENCY MATRIX : Lets assume we have a G(V,E) graph with V vertices and E edges .

We can construct an M matrix with size V*V where M[i][j] represents edge weight of going from node i to node j

Space efficient with dense graphs but requires O(V2) complexity

iterating over edges takes O(E2) memory
