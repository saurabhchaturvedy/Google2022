1 . SHORTEST PATH ALGORITHMS : are used on a daily basis (Google Maps, Waze etc.)

* Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm can find the shortest path between two or more locations quite fast .

* Arbitrage opportunities on the FOREX can be detected with the help of Bellman-Ford Algorithm (detecting negative cycles)

* Shortest path algorithms are used in photo editing software as well (Photoshop, GIMP)

* Computer networks , Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a routing protocol for computer networks that helps to navigate packages
on web


2 . GOOGLE PAGE RANK ALGORITHM : Graph traversal algorithms (especially BFS) can traverse huge networks such as WWW

-> this is how Google's spider crawls the webs and keeps indexing the web pages (page rank calculations)



3. SOFTWARE ENGINEERING : Lets consider software project management such as Maven or Gradle

Problem statement : That packages or modules (dependencies) may depend on each other , i.e the order of compilation is important .

This problem can be reduced to the problem of cycles in a graph and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)


4. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS : Most of the quadratic optimization problems can be transformed into a graph theory related problem


-> Maximum Flow Problem (max flow min cut problem)

-> circulation problem and airline scheduling

-> vehicle routing problem etc .
