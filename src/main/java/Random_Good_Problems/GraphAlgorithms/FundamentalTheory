1 . Graph Theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects .

2 . A Graph G(V,E) is made up of V nodes (vertices) that are connected by E edges (links) .

3 . There are mainly two types of graphs :

(i.) Undirected Graphs : an undirected graph G(V,E) is a set of vertices and edges where the edges are bidirectional . It means that edge
(u,v) is identical to edge (v,u) .

(ii.) Directed Graph : an directed graph G(V,E) is a set of vertices and edges where the edges have directions . It means that edge
                       (u,v) is not identical to edge (v,u) .

Note : Edges may have their own weights as well !!

GRAPH TYPES
----------------


TREE : Tree is an undirected graph where any two vertices are connected by exactly one path .

FOREST : forest is an undirected graph , all of whose whose connected components are trees . (Disjoint union of trees)

DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH (DAG) : It is a finite directed graph with no cycles (crucial in many algorithms)

If underlying graphs have no cycles , then many problems can be solved using graphs

COMPLETE GRAPH : in complete graphs , every single pair of vertices are connected .
